Implement a simple game which is bubbgle gun and object should have health bubbles should be populated at the bottom so that object's mobility decrease if it miss bubbles. And if populated height of any of the column of bubbles reach top game is over. Best score should be shown and reset game option should be seen. Score should be based on shooted bubble and hardness level should be chosen such that arising of bubbles should be regulated based on hardness level
Object should be placed at the bottom and bubbles should propgate down from top to bottom
Can you please make size of random between two acceptable sizes and also maybe you can change logic for finishing game logic
there is bug gaming over logic it overs earlier i dont understand make overing logic such that health of the object reaches to zero object health should be seen at near like bar. And also falling bubles should also be shooting please
gaming logic should be barely on health reaches to zero barely. Plase rearrange it also health bard should be out of game frame but neax to screen vertically
After some point bubbles are not shooting the object why at inital they are shooting but then not and also they might be more offensive
I would like to add sound when bubble is destroyed and also "Game Over" sound. This way, it applies the “Feedback” principle. Audio cues make the interface feel more responsive and immersive. Use the HTML <audio> element and play sounds with new Audio('sound.mp3').play() on events.
I also want to implement that Color-Blind Friendly Mode. Add toggle button for alternative high-contrast or pattern-based color scheme for bubbles and bullets. This applies “Accessibility” and “User Preference”. Not everyone can distinguish red from green.
- I would like to add Tutorial or “How to Play” Popup
    A modal or overlay that shows
    How to move
    How to shoot
    What bubbles and bullets do
    What the difficulty means
    This applies “Help and Documentation”. Users shouldn’t guess how to interact.

-I also want to add  Keyboard Controls
    Use left/right arrows or A/D to move
    Spacebar or Enter to shoot
    This applies “Multiple Modes of Input” — improves efficiency and accessibility, e.g., for players with motor impairments.
- I want to add . Post-Game Feedback Summary
    When game ends, show:
    Final score
    Accuracy (% of shots that hit)
    Bubbles destroyed
    Time survived
    This applies “Feedback and Evaluation” and helps users reflect on their performance.
- Implement functionality such that a user can disable or activate sound effect with settings popup
